# AGENTS.md

Repo-specific directives for coding agents working in this project.

## Behavioral defaults

These guidelines are intended to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Apply them
alongside the repo-specific rules below. They bias toward caution over speed,
and for truly trivial tasks you may use judgment.

### Think before coding

- Do not assume.
- Do not hide confusion.
- Surface tradeoffs.
- State assumptions explicitly when they matter to the implementation.
- If multiple reasonable interpretations exist, present them instead of silently picking one.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so.
- Push back when warranted.
- If something material is unclear or risky, stop, name what is confusing, and ask instead of guessing.

### Simplicity first

- Solve the requested problem with the minimum code necessary.
- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No flexibility or configurability that was not requested.
- No error handling for scenarios that are effectively impossible in context.
- If a solution feels overbuilt for the task, simplify it before considering it done.
- If you write 200 lines and the same result could be achieved in 50, rewrite it.
- Ask: would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated? If yes, simplify.

### Surgical changes

- Touch only what is needed for the request.
- Do not "clean up" adjacent code, comments, formatting, or structure unless the change requires it.
- Match the existing style and patterns of the codebase unless the user asks for a broader refactor.
- If you notice unrelated dead code or issues nearby, mention them instead of fixing them opportunistically.
- Remove imports, variables, functions, or other artifacts that your change makes unused.
- Do not delete unrelated pre-existing dead code unless asked.
- Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### Prefer focused tools over ad hoc shell

Use repository-aware file inspection and edit tools for file operations. Reserve
shell commands for things that genuinely require shell execution: `sl`
(Sapling) commands, `gh`, dependency installation, or `nox` / `pytest` /
`python` for tests, linting, and other repo tooling.

- Use `rg` for text search and `rg --files` for file discovery.
- Avoid inline Python snippets (`python -c ...`) when a dedicated tool or standard CLI utility is sufficient.
- Use structured tools such as `jq` to parse JSON shell output instead of piping to Python.

### Goal-driven execution

- Translate requests into concrete success criteria that can be verified.
- For bug fixes, prefer reproducing the issue with a test or other reliable check before fixing it.
- For refactors, prefer checks that demonstrate behavior is preserved before and after.
- For multi-step tasks, keep a brief plan in mind and verify each step before calling the work complete.
- Favor specific goals over vague ones:
  - "Add validation" -> write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass.
  - "Fix the bug" -> reproduce it with a test or reliable check, then make it pass.
  - "Refactor X" -> verify behavior before and after the refactor.

## Documentation map

- Website and docs source: [`website/`](./website/)
- Current docs: [`website/docs/`](./website/docs/)
- Development docs: [`website/docs/development/`](./website/docs/development/)
- Plugin docs: [`website/docs/plugins/`](./website/docs/plugins/)
- Versioned docs: [`website/versioned_docs/`](./website/versioned_docs/)

## Reproduction files

When asked to create a reproduction for an issue, place files under `temp/`:

- Single-file repro: `temp/<issue_number>.py`
- Multi-file repro: `temp/<issue_number>/`

## Stop and ask

- If a tracked repo file appears unexpectedly renamed, moved, regenerated, deleted, or otherwise changed, stop and ask before reverting, recreating, reclassifying, or staging over that change.
- Do not change supported Python versions, CI matrices, packaging metadata, release automation, or workflow triggers unless the request explicitly includes that scope.

## Verification

- For any new or changed functionality, test it in two layers when practical:
  - run relevant focused tests with `pytest path/to/test_file.py`
  - run the relevant `nox` session to ensure no regressions
- Hydra core tests run with `pytest` from the repository root.
- Plugin tests run from the plugin directory after installing the plugin, or via `nox -s test_plugins`.
- Use `PLUGINS=<plugin_dir_name>` with `nox` when validating one plugin.
- If the broader suite disagrees with focused tests, trust the broader result and do not call the change verified.
- If live verification is blocked by the current environment, request escalation if that would unblock it. If not, stop and ask for guidance.

## Linting and formatting

Run linting through `nox -s lint lint_plugins` when validating broad changes.
The repo's lint sessions include formatting, import sorting, type checks, style,
YAML linting, and security checks.

For focused local checks, use the same tools the noxfile runs:

- `black .` / `black --check .`
- `isort . --check --diff`
- `mypy --config-file .mypy.ini`
- `flake8 --config .flake8`
- `yamllint --strict .`
- `bandit --exclude ./.nox/** -ll -r .`

## Environment and hooks

- Run commands in the `omegaconf+hydra` conda environment by default.
- When validating contributor setup, shell initialization, or hook behavior, verify it from the same environment a developer would actually use, such as a normal shell session or `sl commit`, not only from a temporary sandbox-only environment.
- Prefer hooks that do not depend on nontrivial user-environment tooling.
- If an environment override is required for one command, explain why it must be part of that same process invocation.
- If a small system tool would materially simplify the workflow, it is fine to suggest it or ask the user to install it.

## Source control and PRs

Use the VCS tooling that matches the current checkout. Some Hydra worktrees are
Sapling (`sl`) checkouts, while others may be plain Git clones.

- Prefer the checkout's native tool for local operations such as status, log, diff, commit, amend, and stack inspection.
- In a Sapling checkout, use `sl` for normal local VCS operations.
- Keep escalated VCS commands minimal and single-purpose.
- Do not bundle staging, environment bootstrapping, dependency installation, and commit creation into one escalated shell command unless there is no practical alternative.
- If a VCS operation requires escalation, ask only for the specific action that needs it.
- Do not force-push, submit, or otherwise update a remote branch unless the user explicitly asks for that outward action.
- Before using low-level fallback commands, such as `git --git-dir .sl/store/git` in a Sapling checkout, stop and explain why the normal workflow is not sufficient.

## Release and news fragments

- Do not commit, push, merge, publish, or otherwise send changes outside the local working tree unless the user explicitly asks for that outward action.
- If a change alters release automation, workflow triggers, deployment behavior, or other externally visible project mechanics, require an explicit user review checkpoint before any commit, push, merge, publish, or deployment action.
- All non-trivial product-user-visible changes should have a news fragment.
- Core Hydra fragments go under `news/`; plugin-specific fragments go under the relevant plugin's `news/` directory.
- Fragment filenames follow the pattern `<issue_or_pr_number>.<category>`.
- Supported categories are `api_change`, `feature`, `bugfix`, `docs`, `config`, and `maintenance`.
- Fragment text must be concise, user-facing, sentence case, and preferably under 80 characters.
- Developer-only tooling, repo maintenance, and CI-only changes do not need a fragment unless they change the shipped product experience.
- The user handles releases. Do not edit version numbers, create release files, assemble release notes, or otherwise perform release-cut steps unless explicitly asked.
- The documented release process lives in [`website/docs/development/release.md`](./website/docs/development/release.md). Do not improvise a manual release flow.

## Reviews

- When asked to review a commit, pull request, or diff, cover correctness, completeness, documentation, and internal consistency.
- Verify that each product-user-visible change includes an appropriate news fragment and that the fragment matches the implementation and docs.
