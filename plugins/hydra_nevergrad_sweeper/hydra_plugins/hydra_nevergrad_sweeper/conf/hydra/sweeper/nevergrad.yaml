      optim:
        # name of the Nevergrad optimizer to use. Here is a sample:
        #   - "OnePlusOne" extremely simple and robust, especially at low budget, but
        #     tends to converge early.
        #   - "CMA" very good algorithm, but may require a significant budget (> 120)
        #   - "TwoPointsDE": an algorithm good in a wide range of settings, for significant 
        #     budgets (> 120).
        #   - "Shiva" an algorithm aiming at identifying the best optimizer given your input
        #     definition (work in progress, it may still be ill-suited for low budget)
