# Copilot instructions

When generating code or reviewing pull requests for this repository, use
`CONTRIBUTING.md` as the source of truth for contributor requirements.

For pull request reviews, check the changed files against the contributor
guidelines and call out only actionable gaps, especially:

- missing or insufficient tests for code changes;
- missing documentation updates for API or behavior changes;
- missing news fragments for non-trivial user-visible changes;
- news fragments in the wrong `news/` directory or with the wrong category;
- non-trivial features, API changes, or behavior changes that do not link to
  prior maintainer agreement in an issue or design discussion;
- validation claims that are not supported by the tests or checks shown in the
  pull request.

Do not request a news fragment for developer-only tooling, repository
maintenance, or CI-only changes unless the change affects the shipped product
experience.

Keep review comments specific and actionable. Prefer pointing to the relevant
guideline in `CONTRIBUTING.md` over restating the whole policy.
