This is a minimal example of a Hydra app. we will evolve it slowly to show-case more Hydra features.
Note that the annotated function takes a `cfg` argument. This `cfg` is an OmegaConf object created and passed in by Hydra.
Please read about [OmegaConf](https://omegaconf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#access-and-manipulation) to learn how to best use it.

### minimal.py
```python
import hydra


@hydra.main()
def experiment(cfg):
    print(cfg.pretty())


if __name__ == "__main__":
    experiment()
```

### Output
By default, Hydra will just pass in an empty configuration object:
```yaml
$ python experiment.py
{}
```

You can use the command line interface to pass in arbitrary values, creating a hierarchical configuration object:
```yaml
$ python minimal.py abc=123 hello.a=456 hello.b=5671
abc: 123
hello:
  a: 456
  b: 5671
```
