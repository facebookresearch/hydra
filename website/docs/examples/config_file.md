Your app evolves, and you now want to use a configuration file to make things more manageable:

### Configuration file
Configuration file (`config.yaml`):
```yaml
dataset:
  name: imagenet
  path: /datasets/imagenet
```

You can pass in a config file for your app by specifying a config_path parameter to the `@hydra.main()` decoration.
The location of the `config_path` is relative to your python file.

Python file (`experiment.yaml`):
```python
import hydra


@hydra.main(config_path='config.yaml')
def experiment(cfg):
    print(cfg.pretty())


if __name__ == "__main__":
    experiment()
```

`config.yaml` gets loaded automatically when you run the app.
```yaml
$ python experiment.py
dataset:
  name: imagenet
  path: /datasets/imagenet
```

You can override values in the loaded config from the command line:
```yaml
$ python experiment.py dataset.path=/datasets/new_imagenet
dataset:
  name: imagenet
  path: /datasets/new_imagenet
```


### Strict mode
OmegaConf supports [various flags](https://omegaconf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#configuration-flags) that are changing the behavior of your configuration object.
One of those flags is the `struct` flag , which cause any attempt to access or set a key that is not already in the config to result in an exception
This is useful if you want to get an error when you have a typo in your command line.

This can be turned on via a `strict=True` in your hydra.main decorator:

```python
@hydra.main(config_path='config.yaml', strict=True)
def experiment(cfg):
    # this would result in an exception
    if cfg.bad_key:
        pass
    # this would also result in an aception
    cfg.bad_key = True
```

As well as trying to insert new variables into the config via the command line:
```text
$ python demos/3_config_file/strict_config.py dataset.oops=true
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
KeyError: 'Accessing unknown key in a struct : dataset.oops'
text
