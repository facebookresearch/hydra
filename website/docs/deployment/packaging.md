You can package your Hydra app along with your configuration.
There is a working example [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra/tree/config_from_package/demos/hydra_app_example).

To install it, check-out the Hydra repo.
You can run it with:

```yaml
$ python demos/hydra_app_example/hydra_app/main.py
dataset:
  name: imagenet
  path: /datasets/imagenet
```

To install it, use:
```text
$ pip install demos/hydra_app_example/
Looking in indexes: https://pypi.org/simple, http://100.97.64.150

```

Once it's installed, you can run it with hydra_app:
```yaml
$ hydra_app
dataset:
  name: imagenet
  path: /datasets/imagenet
```

The installed app will use the packaged configuration files, and not the one from the checkout out repository.
