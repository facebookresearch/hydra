## Hydra FAIR Plugins
1. It brings the correct Hydra dependency and has been tested on the FAIR Cluster.
2. It provides FAIR Cluster specific defaults overrides (for example, ```hydra.sweep.dir``` is set to be ```/checkpoint/${env:USER}/outputs/${now:%Y-%m-%d}/${now:%H-%M-%S}```)
3. It provides a [fairtask](https://github.com/fairinternal/fairtask) launcher plugin.
4. It installs [Submitit](https://github.com/facebookincubator/submitit) launcher plugin by default.

<summary>Downgrade From 1.0rc to stable</summary>

pip install hydra-fair-plugins
```
</details>

### Usage

<details>
 <summary>0.3.1 (stable)</summary>
 
Once the plugins are installed, you can launch to the FAIR cluster by appending hydra/launcher=fairtask or hydra/launcher=submitit
for example:

```
 python my_app.py -m hydra/launcher=submitit db=mysql,postgresql
# or
 python my_app.py -m hydra/launcher=fairtask db=mysql,postgresql
```

Both hydra-submitit and hydra-fairtask are providing sensible defaults for their configuration ([Submitit](https://github.com/fairinternal/hydra-fair-plugins/blob/master/plugins/hydra-submitit/hydra_plugins/submitit/conf/hydra/launcher/submitit.yaml), [fairtask](https://github.com/fairinternal/hydra-fair-plugins/blob/master/plugins/hydra-fairtask/hydra_plugins/fairtask/conf/hydra/launcher/fairtask.yaml))

You can customize fairtask/submitit behavior much like you can customize anything else, from the command line or by overriding in your config file or composing in alternative launcher configuration.
You can view the Hydra config (which includes the config for submitit or fairtask) with this command:
```
python my_app.py hydra/launcher=submitit --cfg=hydra
```
</details>


<details>
 <summary>1.0 (Release Candidate)</summary>
 

For 1.0, ```fairtask``` usage remains the same. To use ```Submitit```, the command changes to:

```commandline
python my_app.py -m hydra/launcher=submitit_slurm db=mysql,postgresql
```

More info on ```Submitit``` launcher can be found [here](https://hydra.cc/docs/next/plugins/submitit_launcher)
