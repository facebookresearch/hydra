title: Strict config errors
---

### Overview
`Strict mode` is enabled by default if you specify a config name in `hydra.main`.
It catches references to fields not specified in the config. This helps with two types of mistakes:

Accessing a field that not in the config file throws an exception:
```python {3}
@hydra.main(config_name='config')
def my_app(cfg : DictConfig) -> None:
    print(cfg.db.drover)  # typo: cfg.db.driver, raises an exception
```

Overriding a field that is not in the config file via the command line prints an error:
```text {1}
$ python my_app.py db.drover=mariadb
Error merging overrides
Key 'drover' in not in struct
        full_key: db.drover
        reference_type=Optional[Dict[Any, Any]]
        object_type=dict
```

### Disabling strict mode
You can disable `Strict mode` by passing `strict=False` to `hydra.main()` 
```python
@hydra.main(config_name='config', strict=False)
def my_app(cfg : DictConfig) -> None:
    cfg.db.port = 3306 # Okay
```

This is not recommended. Without strict mode:
 - Attempting to read a field not in the config object returns None.
- Attempting to override a field not in the config inserts the new field into the config.

You can also disable `Strict mode` selectively within a specific context. To do this, see [open_dict](https://omegaconf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#struct-flag) in the OmegaConf documentation.
Note that strict mode is referred to as `struct mode` in OmegaConf.
