Hydra is a framework for writing flexible command line applications.
The name Hydra comes from its ability to run multiple similar jobs - much like a Hydra with
multiple heads.

## Key features:

* Unified command line interface to run your application locally or launch it remotely
* Compose your configuration dynamically, allowing overriding of everything from the command line
* Run multiple jobs with different arguments with a single command
* Dynamic command line tab completion

The best way to understand what Hydra is good for is to go through some [examples](examples/minimal).
