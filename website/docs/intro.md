Hydra is a framework for elegantly configuring complex applications.
The name Hydra comes from its ability to run multiple similar jobs - much like a Hydra with
multiple heads.

## Key features:

* Hierarchical configuration composable from multiple sources
* Configuration can be specified or overridden from the command line
* Dynamic command line tab completion
* Run your application locally or to launch it remotely
* Run multiple jobs with different arguments with a single command

The best way to understand what Hydra is good for is to go through some [examples](tutorial/simple_cli/).
