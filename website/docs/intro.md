Hydra is an experimentation framework.

Its mission is to make experimentation great again.

Hydra provides a unified command line interface to run your experiments locally or remotely.
it can compose the configuration for your experiment dynamically, while allowing free overriding of the config 
from the command line without writing a line of code.

The best way to understand what Hydra is good for is to go through some examples.
