sidebar_label: Compose API
---

The compose API can compose a config similarly to `@hydra.main()` anywhere in the code.  
Prior to calling compose(), you have to initialize Hydra: This can be done by using the standard `@hydra.main()`
or by calling one of the initialization methods listed below.

### When to use the Compose API

The Compose API is useful when `@hydra.main()` is not applicable.
For example:

- Inside a Jupyter notebook ([Example](../advanced/jupyter_notebooks.md))
- Inside a unit test ([Example](../advanced/unit_testing.md))
- In parts of your application that does not have access to the command line ([Example](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra/tree/master/examples/advanced/ad_hoc_composition))
- If you want to compose multiple configuration objects ([Example with Ray](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra/blob/master/examples/advanced/ray_example/ray_compose_example.py))

<div class="alert alert--info" role="alert">
Please avoid using the Compose API in cases where <b>@hydra.main()</b> can be used.  
Doing so forfeits many of the benefits of Hydra
(e.g., Tab completion, Multirun, Working directory management, Logging management and more)
</div>

### Initialization methods
There are 3 initialization methods:
- initialize: Initialize with a config path relative to the caller
- initialize_config_module : Initialize with config_module (absolute)
- initialize_config_dir : Initialize with a config_dir on the file system (absolute)

All 3 can be used as methods or contexts.
When used as methods, they are are initializing Hydra globally and should only be called once.
When used as contexts, they are initializing Hydra within the context can be used multiple times.

### Code example
```python
from hydra.experimental import compose, initialize
from omegaconf import OmegaConf

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # context initialization
    with initialize(config_path="conf", job_name="test_app"):
        cfg = compose(config_name="config", overrides=["db=mysql", "db.user=me"])
        print(OmegaConf.to_yaml(cfg))

    # global initialization
    initialize(config_path="conf", job_name="test_app")
    cfg = compose(config_name="config", overrides=["db=mysql", "db.user=me"])
    print(OmegaConf.to_yaml(cfg))
```
