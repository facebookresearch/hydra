Sometimes you want to run the same application with multiple different configurations.  
E.g. running a performance test on each of the databases with each of the schemas.

Use the `--multirun` (`-m`) flag and pass a comma separated list specifying the values for each dimension you want to sweep.

The following sweeps over all combinations of the dbs and schemas.
```text title="$ python my_app.py -m db=mysql,postgresql schema=warehouse,support,school"
[2021-01-20 17:25:03,317][HYDRA] Launching 6 jobs locally
[2021-01-20 17:25:03,318][HYDRA]        #0 : db=mysql schema=warehouse
[2021-01-20 17:25:03,458][HYDRA]        #1 : db=mysql schema=support
[2021-01-20 17:25:03,602][HYDRA]        #2 : db=mysql schema=school
[2021-01-20 17:25:03,755][HYDRA]        #3 : db=postgresql schema=warehouse
[2021-01-20 17:25:03,895][HYDRA]        #4 : db=postgresql schema=support
[2021-01-20 17:25:04,040][HYDRA]        #5 : db=postgresql schema=school
```
The printed configurations have been omitted for brevity.

### Additional sweep types
Hydra supports other kinds of sweeps, e.g:
```python
x=range(1,10)                  # 1-9
schema=glob(*)                 # warehouse,support,school
schema=glob(*,exclude=w*)      # support,school
```
See the [Extended Override syntax](/advanced/override_grammar/extended.md) for details.

### Sweeper
The default sweeping logic is built into Hydra. Additional sweepers are available as plugins.
For example, the [Ax Sweeper](/plugins/ax_sweeper.md) can automatically find the best parameter combination!

### Launcher
By default, Hydra runs your multi-run jobs locally and serially. 
Other launchers are available as plugins for launching in parallel and on different clusters. For example, the [JobLib Launcher](/plugins/joblib_launcher.md)
can execute the different parameter combinations in parallel on your local machine using multi-processing.
