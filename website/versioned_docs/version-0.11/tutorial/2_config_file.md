It can get tedious to type all those command line arguments every time.
Fix it by creating a configuration file:

Configuration file: `config.yaml`
```yaml
db:
  driver: mysql
  user: omry
  pass: secret
```

Specify the config file by passing a `config_path` parameter to the `@hydra.main()` decorator.
The location of the `config_path` is relative to your Python file.

Python file: `my_app.py`
```python
@hydra.main(config_path='config.yaml')
def my_app(cfg):
    print(cfg.pretty())
```

`config.yaml` is loaded automatically when you run your application
```yaml
$ python my_app.py
db:
  driver: mysql
  pass: secret
  user: omry
```

You can override values in the loaded config from the command line:
```yaml
$ python my_app.py db.user=root db.pass=1234
db:
  driver: mysql
  user: root
  pass: 1234
```


### Strict mode
`Strict mode` is useful for catching mistakes in both the command line overrides and in the code early.
Strict mode is on by default when you specify a configuration file for the `config_path` argument in `@hydra.main` decorator.
It can be turned on or off via the `strict` argument in your `@hydra.main()` decorator.

```python
@hydra.main(config_path='config.yaml')
def my_app(cfg):
    driver = cfg.db.driver # Okay
    user = cfg.db.user # Okay
    password = cfg.db.password # Not okay, there is no password field in db!
                               # This will result in a KeyError
```

Strict mode will also catch command line override mistakes:
```text
$ python my_app.py db.port=3306
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
KeyError: 'Accessing unknown key in a struct : db.port
```

With strict mode off, accessing unknown keys in the config is permitted and both the above override and the example
below would run.
```python
@hydra.main(config_path='config.yaml', strict=False)
def my_app(cfg):
    cfg.db.port = 3306 # Okay
```
