We gladly accept Hydra plugin contributions. They will be initially placed under the `contrib` folder. 

For all plugins here:
- Code will not be covered by Hydraâ€™s CI.
- Code will not be released to PyPI.
- The plugin authors will be in charge of maintenance. 
- The Hydra team will evaluate whether to promote a plugin from contrib to official from time to time.

To contribute:
- The plugin need to pass the corresponding test suites. Example [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra/blob/main/plugins/hydra_joblib_launcher/tests/test_joblib_launcher.py)
- Instead of updating Hydra's official documentation, please include a `README` with the plugin.
